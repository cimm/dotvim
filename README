# Prerequisites

Build MacVim with cscope if you want to use the Flog gem. Here is how to get it with homebrew:

    brew install macvim --enable-cscope

Don't forget to install ack if you want to use the grep replacement. I went for the homebrew install:

    brew install ack

The Flog gem is needed for showing the complexity score in the sidebar

    gem install flog

# Installation

    cd ~
    git clone http://github.com/cimm/dotvim.git ~/.vim
    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    cd ~/.vim
    git submodule update --init
